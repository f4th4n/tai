## What Can I Do? TLDR;

Stream market data to create and manage orders with a near-uniform API across multiple venues

Here's an example of an advisor that logs the spread between multiple products on multiple venues

## Install

`tai` requires Elixir 1.11+ & Erlang/OTP 22+. Add `tai` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tai, "~> 0.0.75"}
    # Choose your order data store
    # {:ecto_sqlite3, "~> 0.5.6"}
    # {:postgrex, "~> 0.15"}
  ]
end
```

Create an `.iex.exs` file in the root of your project and import the `tai` helper

```elixir
# .iex.exs
Application.put_env(:elixir, :ansi_enabled, true)

import Tai.IEx
```

Run the `setup` mix task to:

* Download dependencies
* Create an orders database
* Generate tai migrations for the orders database
* Run migrations

```bash
$ mix setup
```

## Usage

`tai` runs as an OTP application.

During development we can leverage `mix` to compile and run our application with an
interactive Elixir shell that imports the set of `tai` helper [commands](./docs/COMMANDS.md).

```bash
iex -S mix
```

## Upgrading Tai

Bump the required version number in `mix.exs` and download the dependencies.

```bash
$ mix deps.update tai
```

Regenerate new or updated migrations

```bash
$ mix tai.gen.migration
```

Rerun ecto migrations

```bash
$ mix ecto.migrate
```

## Help Wanted :)

If you think this `tai` thing might be worthwhile and you don't see a feature
or venue listed we would love your contributions to add them! Feel free to
drop us an email or open a Github issue.
